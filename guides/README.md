# Guides

This directory contains the foundational documents of the Multimodal AI Evaluation Framework — a progressive learning and doing system designed to take any practitioner from first principles to a production-grade evaluation program.

---

## Reading Order

The first three guides are designed to be read in sequence. Each builds on the previous one. The fourth guide is a practitioner tool that can be used alongside Guide 2 or 3 — it is the translation layer between product requirements and evaluation specifications.

| Step | Guide | What You Get | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [101 Guide](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/guides/Multimodal%20AI%20Product%20Evaluation%20%E2%80%94%20101%20Guide%20-%20Enhanced.pdf) | The mental model — concepts, failure modes, and why multimodal evaluation is different | 2–3 hrs read |
| 2 | [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/guides/Multimodal%20AI%20Product%20Evaluation%20-%20Getting%20Started.pdf) | The navigation layer — where to start, how to move through the framework, phase-by-phase steps | 1 hr read |
| 3 | [Field Manual](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/guides/Multimodal%20AI%20Product%20Evaluation%20-%20The%20Practioner's%20Field%20Manual%20-%20v2.1.pdf) | The complete operational discipline — 20 chapters, all five contracts, every fix surface, full governance | Reference |
| 4 | [Multimodal AI Evals Language](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/guides/multimodal-ai-evals-requirements.md) | The translation layer — converting PRDs, feature requests, and stakeholder requirements into evaluation specifications using the DECODE framework | Practitioner tool |

## Guide 1 — 101 Guide

**File:** [`Multimodal AI Product Evaluation — 101 Guide - Enhanced.pdf`](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/guides/Multimodal%20AI%20Product%20Evaluation%20%E2%80%94%20101%20Guide%20-%20Enhanced.pdf)

**Who it is for:** Anyone new to multimodal AI evaluation. No prior evaluation experience assumed.

**What it covers:**

- Why multimodal AI evaluation is harder than text-only evaluation — and why polished audio bypasses critical judgment in a way that text never does
- The nine-stage pipeline and where failures actually originate (~34% at Stage 1)
- The Five Quality Contracts and why collapsing them into one score hides failures
- The Five Gulfs — five fundamental gaps between what your team intends and what your system does
- The AMI Cycle: Analyze → Measure → Improve
- The hallucination detection toolkit: decompose-then-verify, NLI approach, key benchmarks
- Seven common misconceptions that consistently cause wasted months
- The evaluation tool ecosystem: when to reach for Galileo, Arize, Braintrust, LangSmith, Comet Opik, Patronus, Langfuse
- Where to start — whether you have a live product or are pre-launch

**Key insight from this guide:**
> *A multimodal AI product is a chain. Its strength is determined by its weakest link — and that weakest link is almost always invisible in the final output.*

## Guide 2 — Getting Started Guide

**File:** [`Multimodal AI Product Evaluation - Getting Started.pdf`](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/guides/Multimodal%20AI%20Product%20Evaluation%20-%20Getting%20Started.pdf)

**Who it is for:** Practitioners ready to build or improve an evaluation program. Assumes the 101 Guide has been read, or that you have some evaluation background.

**What it covers:**

- **Who Are You? Start Here** — a navigation table matching your situation to your entry point, with estimated time to first value
- **The Mindset Before Everything Else** — four pre-commitments that determine whether your evaluation program produces signal or noise
- **The 12-Week Phase-by-Phase Plan** with completion criteria for each phase:
  * Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1–2): Judge Panel, Evaluation Brief, Ten-Trace Exercise
  * Phase 2 — Error Analysis (Weeks 2–5): Traces Coding, Tagged Coding, Causal Chains
  * Phase 3 — Measurement Layer (Weeks 5–8): Human Labels, Evaluator Building, CI Gating
- **Adapting for your team size** — solo practitioner through enterprise context
- **Getting organizational buy-in** — three arguments that consistently work, plus the fastest path to a yes

**The four commitments introduced in this guide:**

| Commitment | The Core Discipline |
| --- | --- |
| Per-Modality, Per-Contract Thinking | Never ask "is this output good?" Ask five separate questions — one per contract |
| Pipeline-First Diagnosis | Trace every failure to its origin stage before proposing any intervention |
| Reading Real Traces | Plan for 60–80% of development time to go to error analysis |
| Pre-Committed Thresholds | Set every quality bar before any evaluation runs — not after |

## Guide 4 — Multimodal AI Evals Speak

**File:** [`multimodal-ai-evals-speak.md`](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/guides/multimodal-ai-evals-requirements.md)

**Who it is for:** AI Product Managers, AI Solutions Architects, ML Engineers, QA and Eval Engineers, and Team Leads who receive product requirements and need a systematic method for converting them into executable evaluation specifications. Assumes basic familiarity with the Five Quality Contracts (from the 101 Guide) but can be used independently.

**The problem it solves:** Most evaluation guides teach how to *build* evals. This guide teaches how to *derive* what to evaluate in the first place — from the language of PRDs, feature requests, OKRs, and stakeholder statements. It is the upstream discipline that feeds T-01 through T-18.

**What it covers:**

- The Translation Problem — why specification debt causes more evaluation program failures than tool or infrastructure gaps
- The Two Languages — PRD Speak (language of intent) vs. Evals Speak (language of contracts), and the Decision Language that connects them to stakeholders
- Why multimodal systems make requirements translation harder — five compounding reasons including modality coupling, the explosion of failure surface, and the demo trap
- The Translation Stack — eight conceptual layers from stakeholder intent to executed eval specification
- **The DECODE methodology** — six steps for translating any requirement into a formal eval spec:
  - **D**ecompose requirements into atomic capability claims
  - **E**numerate modalities and input slices
  - **C**lassify by pipeline stage, quality contract, and failure mode
  - **O**perationalize each failure mode as a measurement primitive
  - **D**efine thresholds, gates, datasets, and monitoring
  - **E**xpress as a formal eval specification
- The Multimodal Eval Dimensions Reference — a lookup table of 20+ named dimensions across ingestion, retrieval, generation, and delivery layers
- The Five Quality Contracts as Eval Anchors — PRD phrases that trigger each contract, with the note that Safety is a mandatory governance overlay across all five
- Six Stakeholder Requirement Archetypes — Executive Vision, Feature Requirement, Safety/Compliance, Performance, User Experience, and Multimodal Consistency — with translation paths for each
- Vocabulary Mapping Dictionary — 15 compressed stakeholder phrases decoded into their eval primitives
- The Multimodal Eval Specification Template — a 15-section formal spec document
- Five worked examples across document Q&A, voice-to-structured-data, multimodal customer support, lease review, and screen-aware voice assistant
- Modality-specific eval considerations for image, audio, video, document, and cross-modal interactions
- The Eval Coverage Matrix — a per-contract × per-modality audit grid
- Eight anti-patterns, each with a named tell, a failure explanation, and a correction
- Monday Morning Actions by practitioner situation
- Five closing principles
- **Appendix: Populating AI Product PRDs with Eval Specifications** — including the Eval Stub, PRD Eval Requirements Section, and Concurrent Authoring Protocol

**Companion templates for this guide:**

| Template | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [T-19 Eval Stub Template](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/templates/T-19-eval-stub-template.md) | 7-section PM-authored artifact that lives in the PRD; seeds the full Eval Spec |
| [T-20 PRD Eval Requirements Section](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/templates/T-20-prd-eval-requirements-section.md) | Container section embedded in every AI feature PRD |
| [T-21 Multimodal Eval Specification Template](https://github.com/hsrivatsa/Multimodal-AI-Evaluations/blob/main/templates/T-21-multimodal-eval-spec-template.md) | Full 15-section eval contract authored by the eval engineer |

**Key insight from this guide:**
> *Every stakeholder sentence is a compressed claim. The translator's job is to refuse that compression — politely and repeatedly — until every quality dimension is named, every modality is inventoried, and every failure mode is concrete enough for a reviewer to score from input and output alone.*
